## Hi! I'm Jennifer ðŸ‘‹ 
### Software Developer in New York

Diligent and detail-oriented software engineer with a strong background in content and digital marketing and a passion for creating intuitive, engaging user experiences. As a seasoned marketer, I took pride in my ability to communicate the value of great products to customers and prospects, but had always been curious about what it took to build them. Now as a software developer, Iâ€™m learning new technologies everyday that enable me to build products that can help people live their lives better.

I take a thoughtful and strategic approach to making decisions and solving complex coding problems, and strive to work in a collaborative, creative and purpose-driven environment where I can make a positive impact.
