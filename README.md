## Hi! I'm Jennifer (she/her), a Software Engineer in New York ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a diligent and detail-oriented software engineer with a background in content and digital marketing and a passion for creating intuitive, engaging user experiences. While I had loved creating content for websites, my curiosity about the technology used to build interactive web experiences led me to learning to code and I got hooked. Now as a software developer, Iâ€™m learning new technologies everyday that enable me to build software products that can help people live their lives better. 

I take a thoughtful and strategic approach to making decisions and solving complex coding problems, and strive to work in a collaborative, creative and purpose-driven environment where I can make a positive impact.

ðŸ’» Currently working as a Jr. Software Engineer at Remesh and ðŸŒ± continuously learning and growing my technical skills in React, Redux, Python, Django and SQL.
