## Hi! I'm Jennifer (she/her), a Software Engineer in New York ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a diligent and detail-oriented software engineer with a background in content and digital marketing and a passion for developing products with intuitive and engaging user experiences. While I loved creating *content* for websites, I had always been curious about the *technology* behind creating the interactions that make experiencing digital content exciting. This led me to learn to code and I got hooked. Now as a software developer, I continue to learn new technologies everyday that enable me to build software products that can help people live their lives better. 

I take a thoughtful and strategic approach to making decisions and solving complex coding problems, and enjoy working in collaborative, creative and purpose-driven environments where I can make a positive impact.

ðŸ’»  &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm currently working as a Jr. Software Engineer at Remesh,
<br>
ðŸŒ±  &nbsp;&nbsp; And continuously learning and growing my technical skills in React, Redux, TypeScript, Python, Django and SQL.
